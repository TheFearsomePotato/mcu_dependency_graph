## What is this?
This is a [dependency graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph) that trys to make sense of the movies and series of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If you want to watch a movie or series, find it on the graph and follow every outgoing arrow from it. If you have watched all of the nodes pointed to from the one you want to watch, you are ready to enjoy it.
If you didn't watch a movie or series, you should watch it first (but look up if you have watched its dependencys).

## Why is this?
The MCU is growing ever faster and bigger. At this point its hard to create the "one" watch order or keep it in your head. This graph tries to make it easier.

## Who made this?
This graph is inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/7ko0b1/mcu_movie_dependency_chart_leading_to_infinity/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) one. It is quite outdated, so I thought it would be usefull to create a new one.

## How to render it?
This was (sadly) created on Windows. Install graphviz, and execute the build task defined for vscode (or copy the command from the file). 

## How to contribute?
The creation of this graph is still in progress and it might include errors. If you have any suggestions to improve it, feel free to create issues. Please do not spoil anything. Help for the styling or the structure of the project is greatly appreciated as well.
I have no clue how to properly host a puplic repo, so this is somewhat a learning experience for me.
